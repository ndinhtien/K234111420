  <h2 style="color:red;">Doc-Centric Sales: West Region</h2>
  <p>
    Sales in the west were the most successful of the four regions. Some of Doc-Centric's success can be attributed to our long-standing base of customers. The sales of the M100-11 model were particularly encouraging. We anticipate even greater success in the current year.
